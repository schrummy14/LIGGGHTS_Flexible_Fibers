## Description of Added Files

This package contains a user-created expansion to LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC.
Specifically, this adds flexible stiff fibers to LIGGGHTS, like wheat
straw, plastic straws, grass, and others. You will find examples on
how to use this package in examples/BondPackage. This is an updated
version of the bond package first completed by richti83 for LIGGGHTS
3.3 (https://github.com/richti83/LIGGGHTS-WITH-BONDS). If you find
this work helpful to you, please also reference the following paper,
along with the LIGGGHTS paper.

Thank you to the Department of Particulate Flow Modelling at Johannes
Kepler University in Linz, Austria http://www.jku.at/pfm for releasing
their dynamic insertion code!

This also contains the source files for the JKR contact model as
provided by eidevag (https://github.com/eidevag/LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC-JKR).
Please cite the following paper when utilizing the JKR model.
